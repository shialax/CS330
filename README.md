How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I start by understanding the requirements and identifying the core functionalities needed. I create high-level designs using flowcharts or UML diagrams to map out the system architecture. This includes defining the main components, their interactions, and data flow. I also focus on modularity, ensuring the design supports maintainability and scalability. User experience and performance considerations are integrated early in the design process.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on the project has honed my skills in modular design, allowing me to break down complex functionalities into manageable, reusable components. I've also improved in creating flexible, adaptable designs that can easily incorporate future changes or enhancements. Additionally, I've gained experience in integrating user feedback into design iterations to improve usability.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
For my project work, I followed an iterative design process. Initially, I gathered and analyzed requirements, then created a conceptual design. I built prototypes to validate the design and gathered feedback. Based on the feedback, I refined the design, adding more details and improving functionality. This cycle of prototyping, feedback, and refinement continued until the design met all requirements and was ready for implementation.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The iterative design approach, focusing on modularity and user feedback, can be applied to future projects to ensure they are adaptable and user-friendly. By continuously refining the design through iterations and maintaining a modular architecture, future projects can be more easily maintained, scaled, and improved upon based on user needs and technological advancements.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach program development by first understanding the problem domain and breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. I use a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, starting with high-level functionalities and progressively refining them into detailed, executable code. Testing is integrated throughout development to ensure correctness and reliability.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
In developing my 3D scene, I adopted agile development strategies, focusing on iterative development and frequent testing. I also leveraged object-oriented programming to create reusable and maintainable code. Utilizing libraries and frameworks for graphics rendering allowed me to focus on higher-level functionalities and improve efficiency.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was crucial in my development process. By iteratively developing features and continuously testing and refining them, I was able to quickly identify and resolve issues. This approach also allowed me to incorporate feedback and make adjustments early in the development cycle, leading to a more robust and user-friendly final product.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Throughout the milestones, my approach evolved to become more structured and methodical. I placed greater emphasis on planning and design before diving into coding. I also adopted more rigorous testing practices and incorporated version control to manage changes effectively. These practices led to a more organized development process and a higher-quality final product.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides a strong foundation in problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical skills. It equips me with the tools to develop innovative solutions, automate tasks, and analyze data effectively. These skills are applicable across various fields and can help me achieve my goals by enabling me to tackle complex challenges and drive technological advancements.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have enhanced my understanding of mathematical and algorithmic principles, particularly in rendering and animation. These skills are valuable for fields such as data science, virtual reality, and game development. They allow me to create visual representations of complex data, improving comprehension and communication in my educational pursuits.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In a professional context, computational graphics and visualizations enable me to develop engaging and interactive user interfaces, enhance data presentation, and create simulations. These skills are highly sought after in industries like entertainment, engineering, and data analysis. They allow me to create compelling visual content and provide insights through visual data exploration, making me a valuable asset in any technical team.
